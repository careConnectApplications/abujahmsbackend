assets/:

Store your images, fonts, or other static files (like icons) here.
Example: logo.png, background.jpg, etc.
components/:

Reusable UI components that don’t belong to a specific page but are used in multiple parts of the application.
These could be generic components like buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc.
Example:
Button.js
Header.js
Footer.js


pages/:

Components that represent entire views or pages in the application. These are typically connected to routes in React Router.
Example:
HomePage.js
LoginPage.js
DashboardPage.js
services/:

Contains logic for making API requests, interacting with third-party services, or managing local storage, etc.
These files often abstract external dependencies so that your components remain clean and only focus on UI.
Example:
api.js (all API call logic)
authService.js (authentication-related functions)

styles/:

Global styles such as App.css or App.scss. This directory can also include CSS modules, styled-components, or a custom theme file if using a design system.
Example:
global.css
theme.scss
utils/:

Store utility functions and helper functions that can be reused across your app.
Example:
formatDate.js (for date formatting)
validateEmail.js (for email validation)
router.js:

If you're using React Router or any other routing mechanism, you may want to separate the route configuration into its own file to keep App.js clean.
theme.js:
If you're using a custom design system or a UI framework like Material-UI or styled-components, this file could contain your theme configuration.


1. Naming Conventions:

Use PascalCase for React components (MyComponent.js).
Use camelCase for variable names, functions, and hooks (fetchData, handleClick).
Use snake_case or kebab-case for filenames if needed, but keep it consistent.

2. Indentation and formatting: Ensure consistent indentation (usually 2 or 4 spaces) and formatting across all files. Prefer Prettier or similar tools to enforce automatic code formatting.

3. Avoid magic numbers: Avoid hardcoding values directly in JSX/JS, and use variables or constants for better readability.

4. Code Complexity
Keep functions and components small: Functions and components should have one responsibility. If a function or component is too large, it should be split into smaller, reusable components or functions.
Avoid large components: Components should generally be no larger than 300-400 lines. If they exceed this limit, consider refactoring into smaller components.

5. Commenting and Documentation
Clear and meaningful comments: Avoid over-commenting, but when necessary, explain why certain decisions are made, especially if the code is complex or non-obvious.

6. Error Handling
Handle errors gracefully: Ensure that all asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls) handle errors properly using try-catch blocks or .catch() chains.

Show user-friendly error messages: If an error occurs in a component, provide an appropriate message to the user.

7. Component reusability: Ensure components are generic and reusable. Avoid hardcoding specific values inside components and instead pass them as props.

Props destructuring: Use destructuring to access props in function components

Prop validation: Use PropTypes (or TypeScript for static type checking) to define and validate props for each component.

8. Conditional Rendering
Avoid unnecessary ternary operators: When multiple conditions are checked, avoid deeply nested ternary operators, as they can be confusing. Use if statements or switch-case for complex conditions.

9. Optimization
Avoid unnecessary re-renders: Make sure to use React.memo() for functional components that don’t depend on frequent prop changes, and use useMemo and useCallback to memoize expensive operations and functions respectively.

10. API Calls and Asynchronous Logic
Avoid making API calls directly in components: If an API call is required, extract it into a service to keep the component focused on UI logic.

Use async/await: Prefer using async/await for asynchronous operations over .then(), as it leads to cleaner, more readable code.

11.  Security and Accessibility Security:
Ensure that user input is sanitized and validated to prevent vulnerabilities such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
